# OTMRT Helper

This is a Next.js 14 project (app directory) for managing and verifying contacts (OTM helper).

Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies (npm)
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

Notes
- The project uses Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and several Radix UI components.
- There are no required environment variables detected in the codebase.
- The project includes a `pnpm-lock.yaml` so you can use pnpm if desired.
 - You can add a new contact directly in the UI using the "Add contact" button in the Contacts view — added contacts are persisted to localStorage.
 - Keyboard shortcut: press Ctrl+J to open the Add Contact dialog when viewing the contacts list.
